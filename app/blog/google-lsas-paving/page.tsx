                <p className="text-lg">
                  Imagine paying just $30 for a phone call from a homeowner who needs their
                  driveway paved. Not a click. Not an impression. An actual phone call from
                  someone ready to hire a paving contractor. That's the power of Google Local
                  Service Ads, and it's why they're revolutionizing lead generation for paving
                  contractors.

                <p>
                  Google Local Service Ads appear at the very top of search results - above
                  Google Ads, above organic results, above everything. They're the first thing
                  people see when searching for "paving contractor near me" or "driveway paving."
                </p>
                <p>Key features that make LSAs unique:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li><strong>Pay Per Lead, Not Per Click:</strong> You only pay when someone calls or messages you</li>
                  <li><strong>Google Guaranteed Badge:</strong> Builds instant trust with homeowners</li>
                  <li><strong>Pre-Screened Leads:</strong> Google verifies service area and availability</li>
                  <li><strong>Top Position:</strong> Always appear first in search results</li>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Why LSAs Work So Well for Paving</h2>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. High-Intent Searches</h3>
                <p>
                  People searching for paving services are ready to buy. They're not browsing.
                  They have a cracked driveway, a pothole problem, or a new construction project.
                  They need help NOW.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">2. Trust Factor</h3>
                <p>
                  The Google Guaranteed badge is powerful. Google backs your work up to $2,000.
                  For homeowners nervous about hiring contractors, this removes the risk.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">3. Local Focus</h3>
                <p>
                  LSAs only show your ad to people in your service area. No wasted impressions
                  from people 100 miles away. Every lead is local and serviceable.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">4. Mobile Dominance</h3>
                <p>
                  70% of paving searches happen on mobile. LSAs are designed for mobile with
                  prominent call buttons. One tap and they're calling you.
