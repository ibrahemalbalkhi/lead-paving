                  85% of homeowners search online before hiring contractors, yet most paving companies
                  still rely on word-of-mouth and outdated marketing methods. Meanwhile, smart contractors
                  are using Google Ads to book jobs weeks in advance.

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Why Google Ads Work So Well for Paving Contractors</h2>

                <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                  Before we dive into tactics, let's understand why Google Ads are perfect for paving businesses:
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">High-Intent Customers</h3>
                <p>
                  When someone searches "driveway paving near me" or "asphalt repair contractors," they're not browsing.
                  They have a problem and need it fixed. These are customers ready to hire and spend money.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Local Focus</h3>
                <p>
                  Paving is inherently local. Google Ads let you target customers within your exact service area,
                  so you're not wasting money on people too far away to serve.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Measurable Results</h3>
                <p>
                  Unlike traditional advertising, you can track exactly how many calls, leads, and jobs come from
                  your Google Ads campaigns. This makes it easy to calculate ROI and optimize performance.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Google Local Service Ads: Your Secret Weapon</h2>

                <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                  Google Local Service Ads (LSAs) are the fastest way to get your paving company visible online.
                  These ads appear at the very top of Google search results - above everything else.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why LSAs Are Perfect for Paving Contractors</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li><strong>Pay Per Lead:</strong> You only pay when someone actually calls or messages you</li>
                  <li><strong>Google Guaranteed Badge:</strong> Builds instant trust with homeowners</li>
                  <li><strong>Pre-Screened Leads:</strong> Google verifies service area and availability</li>
                  <li><strong>Top Position:</strong> Always appear first in search results</li>
                  <li><strong>Mobile Optimized:</strong> Perfect for on-the-go searches</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">LSA Setup Process</h3>
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li><strong>Background Check:</strong> Google requires license verification and background checks</li>
                  <li><strong>Service Areas:</strong> Define exactly where you work</li>
                  <li><strong>Budget Setting:</strong> Start with $50-100/day and adjust based on results</li>
                  <li><strong>Business Hours:</strong> Set when you can answer the phone</li>
                  <li><strong>Services Offered:</strong> List all your paving services</li>
                </ol>

                <p className="text-lg">
                  <strong>Expected Results:</strong> Most paving contractors see their first LSA lead within 24-48 hours.
                  Average cost per lead: $25-60. Conversion rate: 15-25%.

                <p>
                  Reviews are the lifeblood of local paving contractors. We implement an
                  automated system that:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>Sends review requests via SMS 3 days after job completion</li>
                  <li>Provides direct links to Google review page</li>
                  <li>Includes templates to make reviewing easy</li>
                  <li>Follows up if no response</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Most contractors see 5-10 new 5-star reviews in the first 30 days. Each
                  review increases conversion rates by approximately 2%.
